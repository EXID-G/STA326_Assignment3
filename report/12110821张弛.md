## Introduction

In this assignment, we are asked to implement three methods introduced in the paper [Neural collaborative filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031), including **GMF, MLP, and NeuMF**. All of models should be evaluated by metrics HR@10 and NDCG@10. Additionally, the study of impact of layer's number on MLP should be taken.
